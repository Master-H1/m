CHAP 1. INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONIC WORKSHOP AND TOOLS 

            Objectives:
At the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the use of electronic workshop
2. Differentiate various tools and equipments being used in workshop
3. Clearly, state the application of each and every equipment.

               Introduction
Electronics is the branch of engineering which deals with the electrons flowing through vacuum, a gas or semiconductors.
The “Electronics” derives its name from electron present in all materials.
Electrical deals with current conduction through conductors and electrolytes but Electronics deals with current conduction through vacuum, gas or semiconductors and also Electronics deals with electronic devices and their utilization. An electronic device is that in which electrons flow through a vacuum, a gas or semiconductor.
From electrical engineering point of view all materials used in electronics can be divided into conductors, semiconductors and insulators. 
Conductors: are substances whose conductivity is very high at normal temperature. It means that the atom of the conductor can easily release electrons (valence electrons) to become free and contribute to conduction. They thus allow a current to flow easily.
